	"description": "Add a vi editing mode to textarea and input elements, so you can use vim keys/shortcuts to edit and navigate text.\n\nAutomatic and non-intrusive: By default, inputs/textareas work as they normally do (insert mode, handled by the browser). Hitting escape enables command mode on the focused element. The only change in appearance of the element is a box-shadow, it is otherwise just a regular textarea/input element. When in insert mode again, the textarea/input element is back under control and in style of the browser, with one exception: The tab key inserts a literal tab instead of changing focus. Original tab handling is restored on element blur, triggered by hitting the tab key while in command mode.\n\nFeatures:\n- Command, visual and visual-line modes.\n- Undo/redo.\n- Repeat.\n\nBecause vi editing mode uses standard textarea/input elements, behaviour deviates from vi/vim in various ways.",
